                <div>If you have minimal experience in computer science and coding, I highly recommend starting with Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. In fact, this very website that you're on was made for Harvard's CS50 Final Project. After just 10 weeks of content, you too could be achieving this level proficiency or even more! <span id="dots">...</span></div>

                <!-- description taken from  https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0-->
                <div> It is an entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, it teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. You can sign up for the course for free and complete in at your own pace here is a link to sign up! <a class="gold" href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">Harvard CS50 sign up</a> </div>
                <br>
                <div>I will admit that the course was daunting at first as the jump from the lecture content to the problem set is fairly huge, but you will soon realise Google and Stackoverflow are your best friends to work through any bugs you face! Don't give up and I guarantee by week 5 of the course you will like programming and coding comes natural to you!</div>
